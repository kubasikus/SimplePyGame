# SimplePyGame

The goal of this project is to create a simple text game where player can choose a nation and fight in a nuclear war against other players by choosing from a list of actions. The goal is to survive and gather as many points as possible.

1. Create a class to hold basic information about single nation
  * Nation_name
  * Lives
  * Score
  
2. Add functions that enable modification of object's variables
  * Change_name
  * Set_lives
  * Set_score
  
3. Create main loop which outputs/inputs from CLI and allows the player to take action
